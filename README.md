### A Simple Starter Kit for Stasis using Twitter Bootstrap, Slim, Sass, jQuery, & a Sticky Footer

Just a simple way to start building a static site using some of my favorite tools:
- Stasis http://stasis.me
- Slim
- Sass
- Twitter Bootstrap
- jQuery

It includes
- A Homepage
- A sub-page
- A simple layout
- Navigation w/ "active" state
- a sticky footer
- a Sass file for your custom CSS

I've tried to keep it extremely simple. Please Fork if you'd like to help or make your own version!

*Special Thanks* to https://github.com/punjab/bootstrap-haml-static for getting me started.

Enjoy!
